                    <p>The Board of the Ines Mandl Research Foundation is very sad to announce that our President and Founder, Dr. Ines Mandl, passed away peacefully August 5, 2016 in her 99th year at home. Below is the obituary that ran in the New York Times on Sunday, August 7th:</p>
                    <p><strong>Ines Mandl, Ph.D.</strong> Prof. Biochemistry, Columbia U., Editor-in–Chief Connective Tissue Research 1972-86.  Ines Mandl, a dearly loved cousin, friend and colleague died August 5, 2016. Born Ines Hochmuth in Vienna, April 19, 1917, she married Hans Mandl in 1936. At the time of the Anschluss,she was stranded in Cork, Ireland where she  remained for the duration of the War. During that time she switched her considerable talent for fashion and languages to begin her lifelong love of science studying chemistry at the University of Cork (she was drawn to the library because it provided heat).   In 1945 Ines and Hans flew to NYC with ten one dollar bills sewn into the lining of their clothes. She soon began attending the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn (now NYU Tandon), becoming the first woman to receive a doctorate in chemistry in 1949.  A leader in research on enzymes and elastic tissue, Ines was probably the best-known female biochemist of her generation. Awards for her achievements are numerous and include the Carl Neuberg Medal, the Garvan Medal, Austrian Honor First Class for Science and Art and Golden Honor for Merit, City of Vienna.  A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Chemical Society and a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences, she participated in many international symposia and had gained a worldwide reputation when she retired in 1986. Her generous donations over the years have culminated in her creation of the Ines Mandl Research Foundationhttp://www.mandlresearch.org/ to carry on her lifelong mission of finding cures for connective tissue disease.  Her retirement years were spent traveling extensively (often accompanied by Chris Gorton and his family), including regular stops in Torremolinos, Vienna, NY and her beloved Maui. Always flying economy (not even averse to the middle seat) she amazed her friends with her independence, relentless curiosity, pleasure in small things and encyclopedic memory. She leaves her Italian cousins Egle Schreiber, Graziella Jona, Marianne Bassan and Elisa Bassan and will also be missed greatly by her many friends the world over. Memorial service to be announced.</p>
                    <p>The Board is hoping to schedule the Memorial at the end of September at Columbia University.  Details will be posted on this website.  For further information in the meantime, please contact Steve Harnik (Stephen@Harnik.com).</p>

                    <p>The Ines Mandl Research Foundation (IMRF) is the legacy of Dr. Ines Mandl whose lifelong mission was to find a cure for Connective Tissue Diseases. Towards the end of her storied career as one of the world’s leading biochemists, Dr. Mandl endowed the Foundation for this purpose.  The Foundation, which is a duly qualified 501 (c)(3) private foundation, promotes and supports research in connective tissue diseases, including emphysema and genetic diseases, especially those related to elastin and elastase concentrating in the causes as opposed to the cure or treatment of the disease.  Research support may also include the fields of immunology and bio-chemistry. The Applicant’s Founder and President, Dr. Ines Mandl, has heretofore made grants in these fields of endeavor annually to such preeminent educational institutions as the American Friends of the Hebrew University, Tandon School of Engineering (previously, NYU Polytechnic) and Columbia University.  Following Dr. Mand's’ belief that “...biochemistry is the scientific background that helps to produce all medicines,” the Foundation has a sufficiently broad charter to support all research projects that conceivably may find a methodology and cure for the treatment of Connective Tissue Disease.</p>
                    <p>On August 8, 2016 the Board granted the application of the The Phyllis and Mark Leppert Foundation for Fertility Research, also known as the Campion Fund, a public charity, to support public awareness and to educate the public, particularly women, about uterine fibroids.  The Applicant is organizing a meeting in Durham, NC entitled: <span style="font-style: italic">Uterine Fibroids:  A Case for Women's Health: a meeting for the general public to raise awareness of uterine fibroids, a connective tissue disease affecting 70-80% of childbearing women.</span> For more information about the meeting <a href="asset/uterine_fibroids.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>. The IMRF is co-sponsoring the meeting.</p>
