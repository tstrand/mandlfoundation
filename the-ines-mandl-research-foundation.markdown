body1: The Board of the Ines Mandl Research Foundation is very sad to announce that
  our President and Founder, Dr. Ines Mandl, passed away peacefully August 5, 2016
  in her 99th year at home. Below is the obituary that ran in the New York Times on
  Sunday, August 7th:</p><p><strong>Ines Mandl, Ph.D.</strong> Prof. Biochemistry,
  Columbia U., Editor-inâ€“Chief Connective Tissue Research 1972-86.  Ines Mandl, a
  dearly loved cousin, friend and colleague died August 5, 2016. Born Ines Hochmuth
  in Vienna, April 19, 1917, she married Hans Mandl in 1936. At the time of the Anschluss,she
  was stranded in Cork, Ireland where she  remained for the duration of the War. During
  that time she switched her considerable talent for fashion and languages to begin
  her lifelong love of science studying chemistry at the University of Cork (she was
  drawn to the library because it provided heat).   In 1945 Ines and Hans flew to
  NYC with ten one dollar bills sewn into the lining of their clothes. She soon began
  attending the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn (now NYU Tandon), becoming the first
  woman to receive a doctorate in chemistry in 1949.  A leader in research on enzymes
  and elastic tissue, Ines was probably the best-known female biochemist of her generation.
  Awards for her achievements are numerous and include the Carl Neuberg Medal, the
  Garvan Medal, Austrian Honor First Class for Science and Art and Golden Honor for
  Merit, City of Vienna.  A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American
  Chemical Society and a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences, she participated
  in many international symposia and had gained a worldwide reputation when she retired
  in 1986. Her generous donations over the years have culminated in her creation of
  the Ines Mandl Research Foundationhttp://www.mandlresearch.org/ to carry on her
  lifelong mission of finding cures for connective tissue disease.  Her retirement
  years were spent traveling extensively (often accompanied by Chris Gorton and his
  family), including regular stops in Torremolinos, Vienna, NY and her beloved Maui.
  Always flying economy (not even averse to the middle seat) she amazed her friends
  with her independence, relentless curiosity, pleasure in small things and encyclopedic
  memory. She leaves her Italian cousins Egle Schreiber, Graziella Jona, Marianne
  Bassan and Elisa Bassan and will also be missed greatly by her many friends the
  world over. Memorial service to be announced.</p><p>The Board is hoping to schedule
  the Memorial at the end of September at Columbia University.  Details will be posted
  on this website.  For further information in the meantime, please contact Steve
  Harnik (Stephen@Harnik.com).
