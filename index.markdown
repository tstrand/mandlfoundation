body1: "A memorial luncheon to celebrate Ines Mandl will be held on November 6 from
  Noon until 3:00pm at the Faculty Club at Columbia University.\nThe Faculty Club
  is located on the fourth floor of the Physicians and Surgeons building, 630 W. 168th
  Street, New York, NY.  \nAttending the memorial will also be colleagues of Dr. Mandl's
  who will speak about the Foundation's future plans.  If you have not already rsvp'd
  please do so on or before Nov. 3, by calling Theresa Thompson at 212 599-7575.  \n\n
  Below is the obituary that ran in the New York Times on Sunday, August 7th:</p><p><strong>Ines
  Mandl, Ph.D.</strong> Prof. Biochemistry, Columbia U., Editor-in–Chief Connective
  Tissue Research 1972-86.  Ines Mandl, a dearly loved cousin, friend and colleague
  died August 5, 2016. Born Ines Hochmuth in Vienna, April 19, 1917, she married Hans
  Mandl in 1936. At the time of the Anschluss,she was stranded in Cork, Ireland where
  she  remained for the duration of the War. During that time she switched her considerable
  talent for fashion and languages to begin her lifelong love of science studying
  chemistry at the University of Cork (she was drawn to the library because it provided
  heat).   In 1945 Ines and Hans flew to NYC with ten one dollar bills sewn into the
  lining of their clothes. She soon began attending the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn
  (now NYU Tandon), becoming the first woman to receive a doctorate in chemistry in
  1949.  A leader in research on enzymes and elastic tissue, Ines was probably the
  best-known female biochemist of her generation. Awards for her achievements are
  numerous and include the Carl Neuberg Medal, the Garvan Medal, Austrian Honor First
  Class for Science and Art and Golden Honor for Merit, City of Vienna.  A member
  of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Chemical Society and a fellow
  of the New York Academy of Sciences, she participated in many international symposia
  and had gained a worldwide reputation when she retired in 1986. Her generous donations
  over the years have culminated in her creation of the Ines Mandl Research Foundationhttp://www.mandlresearch.org/
  to carry on her lifelong mission of finding cures for connective tissue disease.
  \ Her retirement years were spent traveling extensively (often accompanied by Chris
  Gorton and his family), including regular stops in Torremolinos, Vienna, NY and
  her beloved Maui. Always flying economy (not even averse to the middle seat) she
  amazed her friends with her independence, relentless curiosity, pleasure in small
  things and encyclopedic memory. She leaves her Italian cousins Egle Schreiber, Graziella
  Jona, Marianne Bassan and Elisa Bassan and will also be missed greatly by her many
  friends the world over. Memorial service to be announced.</p><p>The Board is hoping
  to schedule the Memorial at the end of September at Columbia University.  Details
  will be posted on this website.  For further information in the meantime, please
  contact Steve Harnik (Stephen@Harnik.com)."
title2: About the Foundation
body2: 'The Ines Mandl Research Foundation (IMRF) is the legacy of Dr. Ines Mandl
  whose lifelong mission was to find a cure for Connective Tissue Diseases. Towards
  the end of her storied career as one of the world’s leading biochemists, Dr. Mandl
  endowed the Foundation for this purpose.  The Foundation, which is a duly qualified
  501 (c)(3) private foundation, promotes and supports research in connective tissue
  diseases, including emphysema and genetic diseases, especially those related to
  elastin and elastase concentrating in the causes as opposed to the cure or treatment
  of the disease.  Research support may also include the fields of immunology and
  bio-chemistry. The Applicant’s Founder and President, Dr. Ines Mandl, has heretofore
  made grants in these fields of endeavor annually to such preeminent educational
  institutions as the American Friends of the Hebrew University, Tandon School of
  Engineering (previously, NYU Polytechnic) and Columbia University.  Following Dr.
  Mand''s’ belief that “...biochemistry is the scientific background that helps to
  produce all medicines,” the Foundation has a sufficiently broad charter to support
  all research projects that conceivably may find a methodology and cure for the treatment
  of Connective Tissue Disease.</p><p>On August 8, 2016 the Board granted the application
  of the The Phyllis and Mark Leppert Foundation for Fertility Research, also known
  as the Campion Fund, a public charity, to support public awareness and to educate
  the public, particularly women, about uterine fibroids.  The Applicant is organizing
  a meeting in Durham, NC entitled: <span style="font-style: italic">Uterine Fibroids:  A
  Case for Women''s Health: a meeting for the general public to raise awareness of
  uterine fibroids, a connective tissue disease affecting 70-80% of childbearing women.</span>
  For more information about the meeting <a href="static/uterine_fibroids.pdf" target="_blank">click

  at the top of this webpage for information regarding fellowship/grant applications.'
