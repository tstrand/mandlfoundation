The IMRF is pleased to have supported the Campion Fund's workshop,  **Uterine Fibroids: A Case for Womenâ€™s Health** held in Durham, North Carolina, on March 11, 2017. The workshop was a resounding success by all accounts, featuring a number of presentations by doctors from Johns Hopkins to Duke to North Caroline Central University. 

According to the Campion Fund, "The purpose of the meeting was to raise awareness among women of our region regarding uterine fibroids and to the need for increased treatment options.  Although, classified as non-malignant tumors, uterine fibroids affect 80% of black women and 70% of white women and are a serious public health problem. The develop around the time of menarche and appear to regress at menopause and grow at different rates.  The can develop to various sizes, sometime to a tumor of 20 centimeters, or the size of a five-month pregnancy. They cause pain and serious uterine bleeding and can thus cause severe anemia. In addition, uterine fibroids may interfere with the ability to conceive and they are responsible for pregnancy complications including preterm birth.  This debilitating disease has not had the attention it deserves from either the medical or scientific communities.  Studies estimate that the costs of this disease to the US pubic and health care system is up to $34.4 billion yearly."

A video of the conference will be posted to this website shortly.
