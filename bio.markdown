body1: <p>Ines Mandl ‘47MS CM, is a woman of many distinctions. She was the first
  woman to earn a PhD from then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, in 1949, and enjoyed
  an illustrious career and a reputation as one of the world’s leading biochemists.
  She is unwavering in her belief that biochemistry is the scientific background that
  helps to produce all medicines.”</p><p>To help others, Mandl made a $100,000 gift
  in May 2000 to Polytechnic to establish the Dr. Ines Mandl ’47 ’49 Endowed Scholarships.
  Since then, the scholarships have been awarded 11 times to a total of seven undergraduate
  students studying chemical engineering, biomedical or biological sciences.</p><p>Connective
  tissue is the material inside your body that supports many of its parts. It is the
  "cellular glue" that gives your tissues their shape and helps keep them strong.
  It also helps some of your tissues do their work. Cartilage and fat are examples
  of connective tissue.</p><p>There are over 200 disorders that impact connective
  tissue. Some, like cellulitis, are the result of an infection. Injuries can cause
  connective tissue disorders, such as scars. Others, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
  Marfan syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta, are genetic. Still others, likescleroderma,
  have no known cause. Each disorder has its own symptoms and needs different treatment.</p><p><a
